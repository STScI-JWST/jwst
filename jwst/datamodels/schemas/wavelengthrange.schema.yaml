    waverange_selector:
      description: |
        A keyword which is a selector for the different ranges.
        For MIRI MRS this is a <channel><band>, for exmaple, "1SHORT".
        For NirSpec the identifier is <filter>_<grating>, for example F070LP_G140H.
        For WFSS and TSGRISM modes, this is the list of available filters.

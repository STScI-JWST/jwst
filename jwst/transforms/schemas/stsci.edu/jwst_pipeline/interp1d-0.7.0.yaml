title: >
  A model which wraps scipy.interpolate.interp1d.
description: |
  It computes the interpolated values corresponding to the given
  inputs. Supported methods of interpolation are:
  "linear", "nearest" "zero", "slinear", "quadratic", and "cubic".

  lookup_table:
    description: >
      Table values.

      - type: array
    description: |
      Grid values - each row in the array corresponds to a dimension
      in the lookup table. The grid does not have to be regular.
  method:
    description: |
      Method of interpolation. Supported are "linear" and
      "nearest", and "splinef2d". "splinef2d" is only supported for
      2-dimensional data.
    type: string
    enum: ["linear", "nearest", "zero", "slinear", "quadratic", "cubic"]
    default: "linear"
  bounds_error:
    description: |
      If True, when interpolated values are requested outside of the
      domain of the input data, a ValueError is raised.
      If False, then "fill_value" is used.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  fill_value:
    description: |
      If provided, the value to use for points outside of the
      interpolation domain. If None, values outside the domain are
      extrapolated.  Extrapolation is not supported by method "splinef2d".

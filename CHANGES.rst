0.11.0 (2018-09-10)
===================

The 0.11.0 release is highlighted by the inclusion of steps for resampling
spectral images and time series grism observations.   In addition, this
release had 39 issues closed and a number of pull requests to improve PEP8
compliance, improve performance, and enhance the testing.  The release also
included updated documentation for acessing CRDS when running the JWST 
pipeline and updates to the reference file documentation.

assign_wcs
----------

- Fixed a bug in ``get_msa_open_slits`` which prevented the code
  from finding the msa metafile.                                 [#2322]

- Fixed a bug in computing the slit_y locations for Nirspec MSA
  slitlets with more than one shutter.                           [#2325]

- Added a wavelength correction for the effective velocity of JWST
  relative to the barycenter.                                  [#2359, #2406]

- Updated NRC_TSGRISM to assign source location to set pixel [#2286]

- Fixed bug in assign_wcs for ordering of slits for NIRSPEC MSA data [#2366]

- Implemented support for reading and writing WCS information in the 
  WAVE-TAB format [#2350]

- Fixed bug in the ording of cube footprint [#2371]

associations
------------

- Implemented Rule for Level 2 Nirspec Fixed Slit background. [#2307]

- Included Handling of both numeric and named slits for Level3 products. [#2330]

- Removed MIR_LRS-SLITLESS and NIS_SOSS from the permanent TSO list. [#2330]

- Implemented new Level2a rule `Asn_Lv2NRSLAMP`. [#2177]

- Allowed "N/A" as a valid, but False, value in association pools. [#2334]

- Implemented new association types tso_image2 and tso_spec2. [#2431]

- Synced code version with jwst package version. [#2458]

- Implemented source naming for NIRISS WFSS Level3 associations [#2443]

background
----------

barshadow
---------

- Fixed a bug in ``bar_shadow.py`` interpolate() that caused
  array index to be nan                                        [#2384]

combine_1d

csv_tools

cube_build
---------
- Removed spaxel.py and replace class with set of arrays [#2472] 
- reworked in mapping of the detector pixel to the sky spaxel so that consistent
  code can be used for both MIRI and NIRSPEC data [#2472] 
- Removed some loops in cube_cloud.py for finding which pixels fall in roi 
  of spaxels [#2472] 
- In a test with MIRI data there was a 13% improvement in the speed of making IFUcubes. In the
  NIRSPEC case there was a 40% improvment in the speed of creating IFUCubes.  

- Fixed bug in cube_build.blot_images that was failing for  NIRSPEC IFU images
  with the slide position defined in the WCS [#2345]

- Updated the construction of cube footprint [#2371, #2364, #2327]

-------------

dark_current
------------

datamodels
----------

- Added a new info method, similar to the method in astropy fits [#2268]

- The ``DataModel`` ``__hasattr__`` method has been replaced by ``hasattr``.
  The former created the attribute when it was accessed. [#2275]

- Improved error messaging when loading fits files into data models. [#2298]

- New warning message when opening a file without DATAMODL keyword. [#2248]

- Included the ability to handle 'allOf' when reading in  schemas [#2407]

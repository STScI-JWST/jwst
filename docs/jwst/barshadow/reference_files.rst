Reference File
==============
The barshadow step does uses the barshadow reference file.


CRDS Selection Criteria
-----------------------
The Barshadow reference file is selected only for exposures with
EXP_TYPE=NRS_MSASPEC.  All other EXP_TYPEs should return N/A.

Reference File Format
---------------------

The barshadow reference file is a FITS file that contains four extensions:

======== ===== ============ =========
EXTNAME  NAXIS Dimensions   Data type
======== ===== ============ =========
DATA1X1  2     101x1001     float
VAR1X1   2     101x1001     float
DATA1X3  2     101x1001     float
VAR1X3   2     101x1001     float
======== ===== ============ =========

The slow direction has 1001 rows and gives the dependence of
the bar shadow correction on the Y location of a pixel from the center of the
shutter.  The fast direction has 101 rows and gives the dependence
of the bar shadow correction of wavelength.  The WCS keywords CRPIX1/2, CRVAL1/2
and CDELT1/2 tell how to convert the pixel location in the reference file into
a Y location and wavelength.  The initial version of the reference file has Y varying from -1.0
for row 1 to +1.0 at row 1001, and the wavelength varying from 0.6x10^-6m to 5.3x10^-6m.

The extension headers look like this:

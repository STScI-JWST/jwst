Reference File Format
+++++++++++++++++++++
The IFU takes a region reference file that defines the region over which the WCS is valid.
The reference file should define a polygon and may consist of a set of X,Y coordinates that define the polygon.

:channel: The MIRI channels in the observation, e.g. "12".
:band: The band for the observation (one of "LONG", "MEDIUM", "SHORT").
:regions: An array with the size of the MIRI MRS image where pixel values map to the MRS slice number. 0 indicates a pixel is not within any slice.

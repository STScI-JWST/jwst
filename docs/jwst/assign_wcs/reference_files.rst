Reference Files
===============

WCS Reference files are in the Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF).
The best way to create the file is to programmatically create the model and then save it to a file.
A tutorial on creating reference files in ASDF format is available at:

https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwreftools/blob/master/docs/notebooks/referece_files_asdf.ipynb

Transforms are 0-based. The forward direction is from detector to sky.

The disperser reference file contains reference data about the NIRSPEC dispersers (gratings or the prism).

Files applicable to gratings have a field:

The following fields are common for all gratings and the prism:

:grating: Name of grating
:gwa_tiltx:
    :temperatures: Temperatures measured where the GWA sensor is
    :zeroreadings: Value of GWA sensor reading which corresponds to disperser model parameters
    :tilt_model: Model of the relation between THETA_Y vs GWA_X sensor reading
:gwa_tilty:
    :temperatures: Temperatures measured where the GWA sensor is
    :zeroreadings: Value of GWA sensor reading which corresponds to disperser model parameters
    :tilt_model: Model of the relation between THETA_X vs GWA_Y sensor reading
:tilt_x: Angle (in degrees) between the grating surface and the reference surface (the mirror)
:tilt_y: Angle (in degrees) between the grating surface and the reference surface (the mirror)
:theta_x: Element alignment angle in x-axis (in degrees)
:theta_y: Element alignment angle in y-axis (in degrees)

:tref: Temperature (in K), used to compute the change in temperature relative to the reference temperature of the glass
:pref: Reference pressure (in ATM)
:wbound: Min and Max wavelength (in meters) for which the model is valid

DISTORTION
::::::::::


The distortion reference file contains a combination of astropy models,
representing the transform from detector to the telescope V2, V3 system.
The following convention was adopted:

- The output in the V2, V3 system is in units of arcsec.
- The input x and y are 0-based coordinates in the DMS system.
- The center of the first pixel is (0, 0), so the first pixel goes from -0.5 to 0.5.
- The origin of the transform is taken to be (0, 0).
  Note, that while a different origin can be used  for some transforms the relevant
  offset should first be prepended to the distortion transform to account for the change
  in origin of the coordinate frame.  For instance, MIRI takes input in (0, 0) - indexed
  detector pixel coordinates, but shifts these around prior to calling transforms that are
  defined with respect to science-frame pixels that omit reference pixels.


Internally the WCS pipeline works with 0-based coordinates.
When FITS header keywords are used, the 1 pixel offset in FITS coordinates is accounterd for
internally in the pipeline.

The model is a combination of polynomials.

:model: Transform from detector to an intermediate frame (instrument dependent).

FILTEROFFSET
::::::::::::

The filter offset reference file is an ASDF file that contains a dictionary of row and column offsets for the MIRI imaging dataset. The filter offset reference file contains a dictionary in the tree that is indexed by the instrument filter. Each filter points to two fields - row_offset and column_offset. The format is

:miri_filter_name:
    :column_offset: Offset in x (in arcmin)
    :row_offset: Offset in y (in arcmin)

FORE
::::

The FORE reference file stores the transform through the Filter Wheel Assembly (FWA). It has two fields - “filter” and “model”. The transform through the FWA is chromatic. It is represented as a Polynomial of two variables whose coefficients are wavelength dependent. The compound model takes three inputs - x, y positions and wavelength.

:filter: Filter name.
:model: Transform through the Filter Wheel Assembly (FWA).

FPA
:::

The FPA reference file stores information on the metrology of the Focal Plane Assembly (FPA) which consists of two Sensor Chip Arrays (SCA), named NRS1 and NRS2.

The reference file contains two fields : “nrs1_model” and “nrs2_model”. Each of them stores the transform (shift and rotation) to transform positions from the FPA to the respective SCA. The output units are in pixels.

:nrs1_model: Transform for the NRS1 detector.

For the MIRI LRS mode the file is in FITS format.
The reference file contains the zero point offset for the slit relative to the full field of view.
For the Fixed Slit exposure type the zero points in X and Y are stored in the header of the second HDU in the
'IMX' and 'IMY' keywords. For the Slitless exposure type they are stored in the header of the second HDU in
FITS keywords 'IMXSLTl' and 'IMYSLTl'. For both of the exposure types, the zero point offset is 1 based and the
X (e.g., IMX) refers to the column and Y refers to the row.

For the MIRI MRS the file is in ASDF format with the following structure.

:channel: The MIRI channels in the observation, e.g. "12".
:band: The band for the observation (one of "LONG", "MEDIUM", "SHORT").

                       <slice_number> is the actual slice number (s), computed by s = channel * 100 + slice

For NIRISS SOSS mode the file is in ASDF format with the following structure.

:channel: The MIRI channels in the observation, e.g. "12".
:band: The band for the observation (one of "LONG", "MEDIUM", "SHORT").

WAVELENGTHRANGE
:::::::::::::::



FOR MIRI MRS the wavelengthrange file consists of two fields which define te wavelength range for each combination of a channel and band.

:channels: An ordered list of all possible channel and band combinations for MIRI MRS, e.g. "1SHORT".
:wavelengthrange: An ordered list of (lambda_min, lambda_max) for each item in the list above

For NIRSPEC the file is a dictionary storing information about default wavelength range and spectral order for each combination of filter and grating.

:filter_grating:
                 :order: Default spectral order
                 :range: Default wavelength range

For NIRCAM WFSS and TSGRIM modes and NIRISS WFSS mode the wavelengthrange file contains the wavelength limits to use when caluclating the minimum and maximum dispersion extents on the detector. The selection of the
correct minimum and maximum wavelength range is done with the following logic, where the index of
the desired filter is used as the reference into wrange_selector, and the same for the index of the order:

wave_min, wave_max = wrange[order][wrange_selector[filter name]]

:order: a list of orders
:wrange: a 2D list of wavelength ranges, ordered in the same way as the orders
:wrange_selector: The list of FILTER names, these are used to select the correct wavelength range

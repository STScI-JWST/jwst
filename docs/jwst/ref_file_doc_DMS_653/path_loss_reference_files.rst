Reference File Types
--------------------
The pathloss correction step uses a pathloss reference file.


CRDS Selection Criteria
-----------------------
Pathloss reference files are selected on the basis of EXP_TYPE
values for the input science data set.  Only NIRSPEC IFU, FIXEDSLIT and
MSA data, and NIRISS SOSS data perform a pathloss correction.


Pathloss Reference File Formats
-------------------------------
The PATHLOSS reference files are FITS files with extensions for each
of the aperture types. The FITS primary data array is assumed to be empty.

The NIRSPEC IFU reference file has four extensions, one pair for
point sources, and one pair for uniform sources.  In each pair, there are
either 3-d arrays for point sources, because the pathloss correction depends
on the position of the source in the aperture, or 1-d arrays for uniform
sources.  The pair of arrays are the pathloss correction itself as a function
of decenter in the aperture (pointsource only) and wavelength, and the variance
on this measurement (currently estimated).

The NIRSPEC FIXEDSLIT reference file has this FITS structure:

HDU #1-4 are for the S200A1 aperture, while #5-8 are for S200A2,
#9-12 are for S200B1 and #13-16 are for S1600A1.  Currently there is
no information for the S400A1 aperture.

The NIRSPEC IFU reference file just has 4 extensions after the primary HDU,
as the behavior of each slice is considered identical.

The NIRSPEC MSASPEC reference file has 2 sets of 4 extensions, one for the 1x1
aperture size, and one for the 1x3 aperture size.  Currently there are no other
aperture sizes.

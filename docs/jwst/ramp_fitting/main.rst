Description
============

This step determines the mean count rate for each pixel by performing a linear
fit to the data in the input (jump) file.  The fit is done using "ordinary
least squares" (the "generalized least squares" is no longer an option).
The fit is performed independently for each pixel.  There are up to three
output files. The primary output file, giving the slope at each pixel, is
always produced.  If the input exposure contains more than one integration, the
resulting slope images from each integration are stored as a data cube in a
second output data product.  A third, optional output product is also available
and is produced only when the step parameter 'save_opt' is True (the default is
False).  The output values will be in units of counts per second.  Following a
description of the fitting algorithm, these three type of output files are
detailed below.


The count rate for each pixel is determined by a linear fit to the
cosmic-ray-free ramp intervals for each pixel. CR-free intervals are derived
using the 4-D GROUPDQ array of the input data set, under the assumption that
the jump step will have already flagged CR's. Ramp intervals are also terminated
where saturation flags are found.  Ramp intervals that are noiseless, or have
no signal, or contain only 2 reads will initially have fits with variance = 0,
preventing their slopes from contributing to the weighted slopes.  In these
cases, the variance will be recalculated as the poisson noise of the ramp added
in quadrature to the pixel-specific read noise, ensuring that all variance
values are positive.  If the input dataset has only a single group in each
integration, the count rate for all unsaturated pixels in that integration will
be calculated to be the value of the science data in that group divided by the
exposure time.  If the input dataset has only two groups per integration, the
count rate for all unsaturated pixels in each integration will be calculated
from the 2 valid values of the science data.  If any input dataset contains
ramps saturated in their second read, the count rates for those pixels in that
integration will be calculated to be the value of the science data in that group
divided by the exposure time. After computing the slopes for all intervals for
a given pixel, the final slope is determined as a weighted average from all
intervals and is written to a file as the primary output product.  In this
output product, the 4-D GROUPDQ from all integrations is compressed into 2-D,
which is then merged (using a bitwise OR) with the input 2-D PIXELDQ to create
the output DQ array.  The 3-D VAR_POISSON and VAR_RNOISE arrays from all 
integrations are averaged into corresponding 2-D output arrays.  If the ramp 
fitting step is run by itself, the output file name will have the suffix 
'_RampFit' or the suffix '_RampFitStep'; if the ramp fitting step is run as part 
of the calwebb_detector1 pipeline, the final output file name will have the 
suffix '_rate'.  In either case, the user can override this name by specifying 
an output file name.


If the input exposure contains more than one integration, the resulting slope
images from each integration are stored as a data cube in a second output data
product.  Each plane of the 3-D SCI, ERR, DQ, VAR_POISSON, and VAR_RNOISE arrays 
in this product is the result for a given integration.  In this output product, 
the GROUPDQ data for a given integration is compressed into 2-D, which is then merged 
with the input 2-D PIXELDQ to create the output DQ array for each integration. The 
3-D VAR_POISSON and VAR_RNOISE from an integration are calcuated by averaging over
the fit segments in the corresponding 4-D arrays.  By default, the name of this 
output product is based on the name of the input file and will have the suffix 
'_rateints'; the user can override this name by specifying a name using the 
parameter int_name.


A third, optional output product is also available and is produced only when
the step parameter 'save_opt' is True (the default is False).  This optional
product contains 4-D arrays called SLOPE, SIGSLOPE, YINT, SIGYINT, WEIGHTS,
VAR_POISSON, and VAR_RNOISE which contain the slopes, uncertainties in the slopes, 
y-intercept, uncertainty in the y-intercept, fitting weights, the variance of the 
slope due to poisson noise only, and the variance of the slope due to read noise 
only for each ramp interval of each pixel. The y-intercept refers to the result of 
the fit at an exposure time of zero.  This product also contains a 3-D array called
PEDESTAL, which gives the signal at zero exposure time for each pixel, and the 4-D 
CRMAG array, which contains the magnitude of each read that was flagged as having 
a CR hit.  By default, the name of this output file is based on the name of the 
input file and will have the suffix '_fitopt'; the user can override this name by 
specifying a name using the parameter opt_name.  In this optional output product, 
the pedestal array is calculated for each integration by extrapolating the final
slope (the weighted average of the slopes of all of ramp segments in the 
integration) for each pixel from its value at the first sample to an exposure time 
of zero. Any pixel that is saturated on the first read is given a pedestal value 
of 0.  Before compression, the cosmic ray magnitude array is equivalent to the 
input SCI array but with the only nonzero values being those whose pixel locations 
are flagged in the input GROUPDQ as cosmic ray hits. The array is compressed, 
removing all reads in which all the values are 0 for pixels having at least one 
read with a non-zero magnitude. The order of the cosmic rays within the ramp is 
preserved.


The fitting algorithm does an 'optimal' linear fit, which is the weighting used
by Fixsen et al, PASP,112, 1350. ('unweighted' in which pixels are equally
weighted, is no longer a weighting option.)  Pixels are processed simultaneously
in blocks using the array-based functionality of numpy.  The size of the block
depends on the image size and the number of groups.


Upon successful completion of this step, the status keyword S_RAMP will be set
to COMPLETE.


The MIRI last frame correction step flags all pixels in the last group of data
in each integration of a MIRI exposure, so that those data do not get used in
either the jump detection or ramp fitting steps.  As a result, the ramp fitting
step does not include any data from the last group of an integration in its 
calculations; for MIRI exposures that have original values of 2 and 3 groups 
per integration, ramp fitting processing proceeds using only the first 1 and 2
groups, respectively, using the calculations described above.  For MIRI 
exposures that originally have only 1 group per integration, that group will 
NOT be flagged by the last frame correction step, so that there will always 
be at least 1 group of data to work with in subsequent steps.  Hence the 
special ramp fitting processing that's applied to exposures that have only 1 
group will be applied to MIRI exposures that originally have 1 or 2 groups.

Step Arguments
==============
The ramp fitting step has three optional arguments that can be set by the user:

* ``--save_opt``: A True/False value that specifies whether to write
  optional output information.

* ``--opt_name``: A string that can be used to override the default name
  for the optional output information.

* ``--int_name``: A string that can be used to override the default name
  for the integration-by-integration slopes, for the case that the input
  file contains more than one integration.

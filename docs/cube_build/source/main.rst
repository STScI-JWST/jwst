Description
===========

This routine takes  MIRI or NIRSPEC IFU calibrated 2D slope images and produces
3-D spectral cubes.  
In this cube_build routine the IFU slice distorted and disjointed 2D spectra are corrected
for distortion and put back together into a rectangular cube with three orthogonal axes, two 
spatial and one spectral with regular sampling in the three axes. The disortion information 
should have been incorporated into the calibrated images using the latest assign_wcs pipeline step.

The cube_build package can take as input either: 

  * a single 2D input image updated by assign_wcs
 
  * a model passed in containing 2D slope image 

  * an association table (in json format) containing the list of exposure to combine


There are a number of arguments the user can provide either in a configuration file or
on the command line that control the sampling size of the cube as well as the type of data that is combined to
create a cube. See the **Arguments** section in the documentation for more details.  



Assumption
----------
It is assumed the assign_wcs step has been run on the data, attaching the distortion and pointing
information to the image. It is also assumed that the input data is from the MIRI or NIRSPEC IFU.


Background Information
----------------------
The JWST integral field spectrographs obtain simultaneous spectral and spatial data on a relatively compact
region of the sky. The MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) consists of four integral field units
providing four simultaneous and overlapping fields of view ranging from 3.7" X 3.7" to ~7.7" X 7.7" covering a
wavelength range from 5 to 28 microns. The optics system for the four IFUs is split into two paths. One path
is dedicated to the two short wavelength IFUs and the other one handles the two longer wavelength IFUs.
There is one 1024 X 1024 SCA for each path. Light entering the MRS is spectrally separated into four
channels by dichroic mirrors. Each of these channels has its own IFU that divides the image into several
slices. Each slice is then dispersed using a grating spectrograph and imaged on one half of a SCA. While
four channels are observed simultaneously, each exposure only records the spectral coverage of
approximately one third of the full wavelength range of each channel. The full 5 to 28 micron spectrum is then
obtained by making three exposures using three different gratings and three different dichroic sets. 
We refer to a sub-channel as one of the three possible configurations of the channel where each
sub-channel covers ~1/3 of the full spectrum for the channel. Each of the four channels have a different sampling 
of the field, so the FOV, slice width, number of slices and plate scales are different for each channel. 

The NIRSPEC IFU has a 3 X 3 arcsecond field of view that is sliced into thirty 0.1 arcsecond bands. Each slice is
dispersed by a prism or one of six diffraction gratings. When using diffraction gratings as dispersive elements three
seperate gratings are employed in combination with specific filters in order to avoid the overlapping of spectra
caused by different grating orders. The three grating span four partially overlapping bands (1.0 - 1.8 microns;
1.7 - 3.0 microns; 2.9 - 5 microns) covering the total spectral range in four separate exposures.   Six gratings
provide high-resolution (R = 1400-3600) and medium resolution (R = 500-1300) spectroscopy over the wavelength
range 0.7 microns to 5 microns, while a prism yields lower-reolution (R = 30-300) spectroscopy over the range 
0.6 microns to 5 microns. 

The NIRSPEC detector focal plan consists of two HgCdTe sensor chip assemblies (SCAs). Each chip is a 2D array of 2048 X 2048
pixels. The light-sensitive poritions of the two SCAS are separated by a physical gap of 3.144 mm which 
corresponds to 17.8 arc seconds on the sky.  For low or medium resolution IFU data the 30 slices are imaged on
a single NIRSPEC SCA. In high resolution mode the 30 slices are imaged on the two NIRSPEC SCAs. The physical gap between the
SCAs causes a loss of spectral information over a range in wavelength that depends on the location of the target
and dispersive element used. The lost information can be recovered by dithering the targets.

Terminology
-----------

**We use the following terminology to define the spectral range divisions of MIRI:**

- *Channel* the spectral range covered by each MIRI IFU. The channels are labeled as 1, 2, 3 or 4.
- *Sub-Channel* each of the 3 sub-ranges that a channel is divided into. We  will designate these as *Short*, *Medium*, or *Long*.
- *Band*  
::
  for MIRI band is one of the 12 sub-ranges the spectral range of the MRS can be divided, each band has unique
  channel/sub-channel combination, i.e., the shortest wavelength range on MIRI is covered by Band 1-SHORT and the 
  longest is covered by Band 4-LONG.  
:: 
   for NIRSPEC is defined by a single grating-filter combination, i.e. G140M-F070LP

**Coordinate Systems:**

An integral field spectrograph measures the intensity of in a region of the sky as a function of 
wavelength. There are a number of different coordinate systems used in the cube building process. Here is an 
overview of these coordinate systems:

- *Detector System*: is defined by the hardware and presents raw detector pixel values. Each detector or SCA 
  will have its own pixel-based coordinate system. In the case of MIRI we have two detector systems because
  the the MIRI IFUs disperse data onto two SCAs.

- *Telescope (V2,V3)*: the V2,V3 coordinates locate points on  a spherical coordinate system. The frame is tied
  to JWST and applies to the whole field of view, encompassing all the instruments. The coordinate (V2,V3) are Euler
  angles in a spherical frame rather than Cartesian. The transformation between the V2-V3 and MRS-FOV system is fixed 
  mission and is determined during ground testing. 

- *XAN,YAN*: like V2,V3 but flipped and shifted so the origin lies between the NIRCAM detectors. Note what OSIM and
   OTE call 'V2,V3' are actually XAN,YAN.

- *Absolute* is the standard astronomical equatorial system of Ra-Dec. 

- *Cube* is a three dimensional system with two spatial axes and one spectral axis. 

- *MRS-FOV* this a MIRI specific system which is the angular coordinate system attached to the FOV of each MRS band. 
  There are twelve MRS-FOV systems
  for MIRI, since there are twelve bands (1A, 1B, 1C,... 4C). Each system has two orthogonal axes, one parallel 
  (**alpha**) and the other perpendicular (**beta**) to the projection of the long axes of the slices in the FOV. 

Output
---------
The input to cube build can be a single exposure or a set of exposures. There are a number of user options that control the
type of IFU Cube to create. If no options are provided then all the data provided in the input will be used to create 
the final cube. In the case of MIRI that means that if the input is a single exposure both channels will be used to 
construct the IFU cube. If the input file is an association containing twelve MIRI exposures covering the four channels 
and three sub-channels and no user options are used then the final cube will be an *uber* cube containing all the data.
In the case of NIRSPEC only exposures from the same resolution will be combined in an IFU Cube, therefore, association tables
will contain NIRSPEC IFU exposures of the same resolution. 
  
Below is a list of the user options that can be used to select the type of data to be used to create the IFU Cube:

* ``--channel #``, this is a MIRI only option and the only valid values for # are 1,2,3,4, or ALL.
  If the ``channel`` argument is given, then only data corresponding to that channel  will be used in 
  constructing the cube.  If the user wants more than one  channel to make cube, then all the values are 
  contained in a comma separated string string. For example, to create a cube with channel 1 and 2 the argument list is 
  ``--channel='1, 2'``. If this value is not specified then all the  channels contained in the input 
   will be used  in constructing the cube. 

* ``--band [string]``, this is a MIRI option and the  only valid values  are SHORT,MEDIUM,LONG, or ALL.
  If the ``band`` argument is given, then only data corresponding 
  to that subchannel will be used in  constructing the cube. Only one option is possible, so IFU cubes are created either
  per subchannel or using all the subchannels the input data cover.  If this value is not specified then all the 
  subchannels contained in the input list of files will be used in constructing the cube. Note we used ``band`` instead of 
  ``subchannel``, because the keyword ``band`` in the science fits is used to denote which MIRI subchannel the data covers.

* ``--weighting ['string]``, the is for MIRI data and the only valid values are STANDARD and MIRPSF. This option defines 
how the distances between the point cloud members and spaxel centers are determined. The default value is STANDARD and the distances
are determined in the cube output coordinate system. If this paramter is set to MIRIPSF then the distances are determined in
the alpha-beta coordinate system of the point cloud member and are normalized by the PSF and LSF.  

* ``--grating [string]``, this is a NIRSPEC option and only valid values are PRISM, G140M, G140H, G235M, G235H, G395M, G395H, or ALL. 
  If the option ALL is used then all the gratings in the assocation are used.
  Since association tables will only contain exposures of the same resolution, the use of ALL, will at most combine
  data from grating G140M, G235M & G395M or G140H, G235H & G395H together. The user can supply a comma separated string 
  containing the gratings to use. 

* ``--filter [string]``, this is a NIRSPEC  option and the only valid options are Clear, F100LP, F070LP, F170LP, F290LP, or ALL.
 To cover the full wavelength range of NIRSPEC the option ALL can be used (provided the exposures in the association table 
contain all the filters). The user can supply a comma separated string containing the filters to use. 


Output Product
``````````````
If the input is passed as an Image Model then the IFU cube will be passed back as an IFU cube model. If the
input is passed as a filename or association table then an output IFU cube will be written to disk. In these cases
the output name is based on a rootname plus a string defining the type of IFU cube created plus the string 's3d.fits'.
If the input data is a single exposure then the rootname
is formed from the input filename; while if the input is an association table the rootname is defined in the assocation
table. 
The string defining the type of IFU is created according to the following rules: 

* for MIRI the string is determined from the  channels and subchannels used. 
The  IFU string for MIRI is 'ch'+ channel numbers used plus a string for the subchannel. For example if the IFU cube 
contains channel 1 and 2 data for the short subchannel, the output name would be, rootname_ch1-2_SHORT_s3d.fits. 
If all the subchannels were used then the output name would be rootname_ch-1-2_ALL_s3d.fits.

* for NIRSPEC the string is determined from the gratings and filters used. The gratings are grouped together in a dash (-) 
separted string and likewize for the gratings. For example if the IFU cube contains data from 
grating G140M and G235M and from filter F070LP and F100LP,  the output name would be, 
rootname_G140M-G225_F070LP-F100LP_s3d.fits
  


Algorithm
---------
Based on the arguments defining the type of cubes to create, the program selects the data from
each exposure that should be included in the cube. The output cube is defined using the WCS information of all 
included the input data.
This output cube WCS defines a field-of-view that encompasses the undistorted footprints on 
the sky of all the input images. The cube sample size for the three dimensions is either  
determined from defaults or set by the user. Each MIRI channel or NIRSPEC grating setting  
has a predefined scale to use for each dimension. 
In the case of MIRI - if the data consists of more  than one channel  of data - the output scale corresponds to 
the channel with the smallest scale. In the case of NIRSPEC only gratings of the
same resolution are combined together in an IFU cube. The output spatial coordinate system is right ascension-declination.


All the pixels on each exposure that are included in the output cube are mapped to the cube coordinate system. This input-to-output 
pixel mapping is determined via a mapping function derived from the WCS of each input image  and the WCS of output cube. The
mapping process corrects for the optical distortions and uses the spacecraft telemetry information in one rebinning step to map 
a pixel from the the detector to the cube coordinate system. The mapping is actually a series of chained transformations 
(detector -> alpha-beta-lambda), (alpha-beta-lambda -> V2, V3 lambda), (V2-V3-Lambda - > right ascension-declination-lambda),
and (right ascension-declination-lambda -> Cube coordinate1,-Cube Coordinate2-lambda).  The reverse of each transformation 
is also possible. 

The mapping process results in an irregulary spaced "cloud of points" in the cube coordinate system. A schematic of this process is shown 
in Figure 1. Two dithered exposures are mapped the output coordinate system. The detector pixels from the first exposure are 
shown in black, while the detector pixels from the second exposure are shown in red.

Schematic of two exposures mapped to the IFU output coordinate system. The point cloud shown by the plus symbols are the detector pixels
mapped to the output coordinate system. The black points are from exposure one and the red points are from exposure two.


Each point in the cloud  contains information of the flux of the original detector pixel and error of this flux. The final flux that is derived for each 
cube pixel (**spaxel**) is a combination of all the **point cloud** values with a specified **region of interest** from the center of 
the spaxel. How to best combine the point cloud values into a final flux is an  on-going process. The current method uses a 
weighting function based on the distance between the center of spaxel center and point cloud member. For MIRI the weighting function
also depends on the  width  of the PSF and LSF. The width of the MIRI PSF varies with wavelength, broader for longer wavelengths. 
The resolving power of  the MRS  varies with wavelength and band.  Adjacent point-cloud elements may in fact originate from 
different exposures rotated from one another and even from different spectral bands. In order to properly weight the MIRI data  the 
distances  between the point cloud element and spaxel the distances are determined in the alpha-beta coordinate system and 
then normalized by the width of the PSF and the LSF. For NIRSPEC the distances between the spaxel center and point cloud member are
determined in the final cube coordinate system. 


* xdistance = distance between point in the cloud and spaxel center  in units of arc seconds
* ydistance = distance between point in the cloud and spaxel center in units of arc seconds
* zdistance = distance between point cloud and spaxel center in the lambda dimension in units of microns

Additional constraints for MIRI (if the --weighting=MIRIPSF) 
If the These distances are determined in the **alpha** - **beta** system from where the point cloud value orginated. We want to combine
many points -possibly coming from a variety of bands- together. To apply the correct weighting to these points we
normalize the distance between the cube spaxel and point cloud value by the PSF and the LSF which where defined 
in the **alpha**-**beta** coordinate system.  We therefore, transform the cube spaxel coordinates to each **alpha-beta** system
that is found within the region of interset. 

* xnorm  width of the PSF in the alpha dimension in units of arc seconds
* ynorm  width of the PSF in the beta dimension  in units of arc seconds
* znorm width of LSF in lambda dimension in units of microns

* xn = xdistance/xnorm
* yn = ydistance/ynorm
* zn = zdistance/znorm

For NIRSPEC  (and for MIRI data when --weight='STANDARD'  the distances are determined in the output cube coordinate system) 

* xn = xdistance
* yn = ydistance
* zn = zdistance
 
Define n  to be the number of point cloud members within the region of interest of a given spaxel.

For each spaxel find the n points in the cloud what fall within the region of interest. The size of the region of interesting
is set by  Radius_X, Radius_Y and Radius_Z and determining the best set of radi is an on-going stufy.  Using these
n points calculated the 

The spaxel flux K =  
:math:`\frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n Flux_i w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}`

Where 

:math:`w_i = \frac{xn}^p + \frac{yn}^q + \frac{zn}^r`

The default values for the p,q,r and 2, 2 and 2 respectively. The optiminal choice of these values is still TBD, but 
one should consider the degree of smoothing desired in the interpolation, the density of the point cloud elements,
and the region of interest when chosing these values.

Reference File
==============
The superbias subtraction step uses a SUPERBIAS reference file.

CRDS Selection Criteria
-----------------------
Superbias reference files are selected on the basis of the INSTRUME, DETECTOR,
READPATT and SUBARRAY values of the input science data set.

SUPERBIAS Reference File Format
-------------------------------
Superbias reference files are FITS files with 3 IMAGE extensions and 1 BINTABLE
extension. The FITS primary data array is assumed to be empty. The 
characteristics of the three image extension are as follows:

=======  =====  =============  =========
EXTNAME  NAXIS  Dimensions     Data type
=======  =====  =============  =========
SCI      2      ncols x nrows  float
ERR      2      ncols x nrows  float
DQ       2      ncols x nrows  integer
=======  =====  =============  =========

The BINTABLE extension contains the bit assignments used in the DQ array.
It uses ``EXTNAME=DQ_DEF`` and contains 4 columns:

* BIT: integer value giving the bit number, starting at zero
* VALUE: the equivalent base-10 integer value of BIT
* NAME: the string mnemonic name of the data quality condition
* DESCRIPTION: a string description of the condition

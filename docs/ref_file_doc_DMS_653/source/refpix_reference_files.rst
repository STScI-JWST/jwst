Reference File
==============
The refpix step only uses the refpix reference file when processing
NIRSpec exposures that have been acquired using an IRS2 readout
pattern. No other instruments or exposure modes require a reference
file for this step.


CRDS Selection Criteria
-----------------------
Refpix reference files are selected by DETECTOR and READPATT.


Reference File Format
---------------------

A single IRS2 extension provides the complex coefficients for the 
correction, and contains 8 columns ALPHA_0, ALPHA_1, ALPHA_2, ALPHA_3, 
BETA_0, BETA_1, BETA_2, and BETA_3.
The ALPHA arrays contains correction multipliers to the data, and the BETA arrays contains 
correction multiplier to the reference output. Both arrays have 4 components - one for each sector.
